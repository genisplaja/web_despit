# web_despit

This is the HTML and CSS coded website for the modern rock band DESPIT, in which I play the bass guitar. 
The website is device size responsive and has a mobile phone version. This is a simple but cool website to
post the latest news about the band and to provide links to streaming services and social networks in which
DESPIT is present.
